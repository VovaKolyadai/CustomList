# CustomList
It is necessary to create a template class that will implement IEnumerable<T> (examples are available online)

Add an overload to the indexer [] operator 

all data should be stored in private T[] _data; 

It is necessary to implement the Add(T element) method that will expand the _data array and add the OnExpandedEvent event that will be called when the array is expanded when adding an element in the Add() method 

add an example of using your array with Linq 

use methods for sorting elements in ascending order and filtering
